Idol-worshiping is very popular among the youngest and different
people have different attitudes towards their idols. Especially, many
 young people worship stars, which absorb most of their attention and 
 money. For example, some young people in high school and university 
 often spend a lot of money to buy concert tickets for stars, and 
 sometimes even skip classes to get idolsâ€™ signatures. Some crazy 
 young people don't hesitate to steal their parents' money, regardless 
 of the ends of the earth, to meet their idols. No one can easily 
 judge whether idolatry is right or wrong, because chasing stars 
 is not a black or white thing. On the one hand, Some youngsters 
 imitate their idols' everything and regard their idols as the most 
 important people. It is the power of these idols that guides them 
 forward step by step. On the other hand, other youngsters always pay 
 attention to their appearance or their achievements. As the saying 
 goes, "one minute on stage, ten years off stage". They will fall into 
 danger and find it impossible to stop themselves. In my view, we 
 should not worship our idols blindly and be crazy after them. 
 Instead, we'd better learn something good from them. Even stars 
 are human beings who will make mistakes. Therefore, It is wise for 
 us to worship rationally.
